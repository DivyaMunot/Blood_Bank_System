# Blood_Bank_System

## Aim: 
To develop a C++ program for blood bank using Object Oriented Programming concepts such as Class and Object, Switch case, File Handling.

## Objective:
1. To explore principles of programming.
2. To use the object oriented paradigm in program design.
3. To lay foundation to advanced programming.

## Essential Information required for the implementation of the program:

### Blood Bank:
A blood bank is a center where blood gathered as a result of blood donation is stored and preserved for later use in blood transfusion. The term "blood bank" typically refers to a division of a hospital where the storage of blood product occurs and where proper testing is performed (to reduce the risk of transfusion related adverse events).
### Blood Group:
A blood type (also called a blood group) is a classification of blood based on the presence and absence of antibodies and also based on the presence or absence of inherited antigenic substances on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs). 

## Project:
This project provides the following functionalities:
1.	Create a new record
2.	Display all the records
3.	Search for a particular blood group
4.	Delete a record
5.	Add a new record
